Test the function calling with real time voice and update memeotri
Autoconnect with push to talk with "X" key.
Deactivate the voice with another key like "Z" or "Esc"
Use "M" / "N" key to directly dictate and save Notes/memories.
Option to add a chat / temporary chat as in you can tlak to teh Book literally after parsing it
Add MIT liscence to it
Add a light mode and a dark mode
LInk the Github repo with the repo
If you are taking too long on a page then the assistant can wake you up and can basically tell you/ ask you where you are stuck. And we can keep it up.
